The calculations for effective question weight for other questions in this quiz are the effective question weight for these questions if the highlighted questions with a negative covariance are given a maximum grade of zero.

If you edit a quiz and give these question(s) with negative covariance a max grade of zero then the effective question weight of these questions will be zero and the real effective question weight of other questions will be as calculated now.',

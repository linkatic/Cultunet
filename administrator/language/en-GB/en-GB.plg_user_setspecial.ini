DESCPLGUSERSETSPECIAL=I've never understood why Joomla only had the threeaccess levels (Public, Registered, Special), when it would have been so easy tohave used all eight (Public, Registered, Author, Editor, Publisher, Manager,Administrator, Super Administrator).<br /><br />Now I know that when 1.6 comes out, this pluginwill thankfully be obsolete, but in the meanwhile it does offer a tiny bit moreflexibility.<br /><br />If like me, you often use the access levels forother things, then sometimes you may not want items (Menus, Menu Items,Articles) to appear in the front end unless say, the users have backendaccess.<br /><br />This plugin allows you to select at which accesslevel Special items become available.<br /><br />Enjoy! 
DESCSETSPECIALLEVEL=Above this Access Level Special items will appear.
